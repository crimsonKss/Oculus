Oculus is an Unofficial Fork of ["Iris"](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders), made to work with Forge Mod Loader.

## Disclaimer
Oculus is not and never will be compatible with Optifine!

## Dependencies
Oculus requires [Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium) made by embeddedt!

## Features
* Performance. Oculus should fully utilize your graphics card when paired with optimization mods like Rubidium.

* Mod compatibility. Oculus should make a best effort to be compatible with modded environments.

* Backwards compatibility. All existing ShadersMod / OptiFine shader packs should just work on Oculus, without any modifications required.

* A well-organized codebase. I'd like for working with Oculus code to be a pleasant experience overall.
